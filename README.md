Message communication between two JVM processes, using sockets.

This is highly experimental and work is in progress.

Web sockets are considered as overengineering for this purpose. But if you are interested in a small demo, you can use the `DocServer` and `DocClient` on the `web.socket.demo` branch for reference / as starting point.
